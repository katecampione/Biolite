  <li><strong>Edge-lighting: </strong>A unique textured pattern on the lens reflects the LEDs on a steep angle creating soft, even light along the entire panel without requiring a cavernous space typical of most lanterns. </li><br>
  <li><strong>High-efficiency LEDs: </strong>Red and white LEDs are located at the top of the design providing 4 key lighting modes. </li><br>
  <li><strong>Rechargeable Battery: </strong>A 1350 mAh battery maximizes burn time and gives the ability to amplify the lumen output with a front-panel point light. USB-charge out gives you the ability to provide a power boost to your gear when on the go. Edge-lighting enables us to hug the battery closely, keeping the design compact and portable.  </li><br>
  <li><strong>Stainless Steel Housing: </strong>Thinner and even more durable than plastic, the stainless steel housing works double time as a heat sink, helping the LEDs run more efficiently. </li>
