           <li>What setting should FirePit be on to use the Griddle?<br>
             <span class="light">The FirePit Griddle works best on a moderate flame with the FirePit fan on LOW. You do NOT need a large flame to cook effectively with the Griddle. You can also cook over charcoal by moving FirePit's fuel rack to the upper level.</span></li><br>
           

           <li>How do I clean FirePit Griddle? <br>
             <span class="light">After cooking, allow the griddle to cool slowly before cleaning. Do not rapidly cool the griddle by adding water, it could cause damage. Clean with non-metal, non-abrasive brush or sponge with mild soap. Dry completely and wipe with a small amount of oil before storing to protect seasoning and prevent rust.</span></li><br>
 
             <li>This comes pre-seasoned â€“ can I do additional seasoning for the cast iron?<br>
             <span class="light">Yes! Proper seasoning will extend the life of your griddle and provide a non-stick cooking surface. It is ready to use out of the box but additional seasoning will improve the surface over time: After cooking, clean with non-metal, non-abrasive brush or sponge with mild soap. Wipe all surfaces with a very light amount of vegetable, canola or soybean oil; Place over your FirePit burning with a small fire or in a 450F oven; Heat for approximately 20 min, the oil will smoke slightly; Remove the griddle from the heat with protective mitts and let cool. </span></li><br>
           

             <li>Does this fit inside FirePit Solar Carry Bag?<br>
             <span class="light">No, we recommend packing Griddle in a separate bag or container with the rest of your outdoor kitchen supplies. </span></li><br>
