         <ul>
           <li><strong>Same smokeless technology</strong> <br><span class="light">Featuring 51 jets inside the burn chamber, enjoy smoke-free flames using the sticks around you.</span></li><br>
           <li><strong>Same weight</strong> <br><span class="light">Yes, same weight! We added a lot of functionality like the battery and LED dashboard but we were able to update key materials to keep our weight at two pounds for the entire stove.</span></li><br>
           <li><strong>Same nesting design</strong> <br><span class="light">You can still pack this down and store it inside the KettlePot.</span></li><br>
           <li><strong>Works with KettlePot and Portable Grill</strong> <br><span class="light"> If you already own the KettlePot or Grill, you're good to go, the CampStove 2 still fits. And if you don't own them â€“ now's your chance!</span></li><br>
