           <li>How long does it take to charge the whole system?<br><span class="light">
             For SHS620, Approximately 6 hours in strong, direct sun. Set your panel up in a high, sunny spot for maximum charging. For SunLight, it takes about 7 hours from empty. </span></li><br>
           
           
           <li>For SH620, How do I tell how much power I'm creating or storing?
             <br><span class="light">The LCD display on the Control Box gives you real-time feedback on sun strength and power available in your battery</span></li><br>
           
          
           <li>Can I leave the solar panel out in all weather?
             <br><span class="light">Yes â€“ in fact, rain helps keep the panel clear of dust for better performance. Just make sure that after heavy storms the panel is clear of debris and has not shifted.</span></li><br>
           
           <li>The Solar Panel has 21 feet of cord. What if I can't reach where I want to hang my Control Box?
             <br><span class="light">No problem -- since your control box is likely in a temporary position, just take it off the wall and move it closer to your Solar Panel! Have it fill up during the day and then move it back to its original position come nightfall - the internal battery will be what's powering the system when the sun goes down. </span></li><br>
           
           <li>Why isn't there an audio jack to play music?
             <br><span class="light">As a crossover product from BioLite, microSD and FM radio are the most common ways to listen to music in Kenya with the added benefit of not requiring power from your mobile phone. Loading up a microSD is easy and keeps your phone free for other functions (for more tips, see here) </span></li><br>
           
           <li>How does the motion sensor work?
             <br><span class="light">One of your 3 hanging lights has an "eye" in the middle of the bulb. Press the light switch 4x until a small red light appears - the eye is now activated and your motion sensor will turn on with nearby movement, keeping the light on for 30 seconds before automatically turning off.</span></li><br>
           
           <li>Can the lights be controlled individually?
             <br><span class="light">Yes! Each hanging light features its own on/off switch and can be set to LO, MED, or HI. They daisy-chain together for a single power source, 
             but their brightness can be controlled individually. </span></li><br>
           
              <li>Can I charge SunLight off of the SH620?
             <br><span class="light">Yes, you can! SunLight can be charged up via micro USB in under 2 hours. </span></li><br>
           
              <li>How do I operate all the modes on SunLight?
                <br><span class="light">Check out this video for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCzYF0lfJRc" target="_blank">quick tutorial</a> </span></li><br>
