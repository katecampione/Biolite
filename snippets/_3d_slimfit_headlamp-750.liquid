            <h6 class="">Fit As A Factor Of Performance</h6>
            <p class="light gray-warm">When youâ€™re doing big things, your headlamp should light the way, not get in the way. 
              Our proprietary construction method solves for that.
<br><br>
              By <strong>integrating electronics</strong> directly into the band, we create a <strong>flush low-profile</strong> front with no bounce.
<br><br>
      The rear power unit <strong>distributes weight</strong> and keeps pressure off your forehead while <strong>moisture-wicking band</strong> keeps you cool and dry.
